# Data Science Skills Analysis
Which skills are actually needed for modern data science jobs?

Here are a couple of humble notebooks using text mining/NLP to investigate which skills are most in demand for modern data science jobs, what skills applicants are promoting, and what the gaps may be.

## Findings
### Top Skills
The most common data skills being called for are:

- machine learning
- statistics
- Python
- SQL




## Data Sources
Unfortunately, LinkedIn, Seek and Indeed all have policies against scraping their sites. Consequently, it was a slow manual process to collect data for this analysis, and the sample size is not as large as I would've liked. It includes only about 100 of each job category, which is prohibitive against using more advanced deep learning techniques, retraining word vectors etc.

## Installation
Create a new virual environment (if you're into that kind of thing) then `pip install` everything in requirements.txt. To visualise Plotly charts you'll have to follow the installation instructions [here](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/), or alternatively just execute the script in the `bin/` directory.
