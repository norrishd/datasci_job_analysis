## Installation
Create your virual environment (if you're into that kind of thing) then `pip install` everything in requirements.txt. To visualise Plotly charts you'll have to follow the installation instructions [here](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/), or alternative just execute the script in the `bin/` directory.
